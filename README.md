# Rusty-v8
- An attempt to port the v8 js engine to rust language from cpp after taking inspiration from the recent porting of typescript to go lang.

## Current State
- Trying to find the optimal way to analyze and convert the codebase.
- Converting the codebase in multiple iterations.
- In the first few iterations, trying to understand the structure of the codebase.
- In the next level of iterations, trying to understand different modules, layers and the flow of the codebase.
- In the final interations, coming up with the plan and converting the codebase.

## The reason to choose rust
- Rust is the only language that comes to close or sometimes on par with the performance of cpp.
