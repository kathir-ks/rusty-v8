// The original C++ header file included other headers, such as

// "src/objects/microtask-inl.h".  Since we don't have the contents of
// those files, we'll create placeholder module declarations for them.
//
// The original also included "torque-generated/src/objects/promise-tq-inl.inc".
// Since we don't have the contents of that file, we will skip it.
//
// The original also included "src/objects/object-macros.h" and
// "src/objects/object-macros-undef.h", which we cannot fully replicate
// without the context of the V8 codebase. The functionality they
// provide is object construction and deconstruction, which, in Rust,
// is handled by the compiler and standard library.
