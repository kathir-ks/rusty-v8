    /// SpillPlacer is an implementation of an algorithm to find optimal spill
    /// insertion positions, where optimal is defined as:
    ///
    /// 1. Spills needed by deferred code don't affect non-deferred code.
    /// 2. No control-flow path spills the same value more than once in non-deferred
    ///    blocks.
    /// 3. Where possible based on #2, control-flow paths through non-deferred code
    ///    that don't need the value to be on the stack don't execute any spills.
    /// 4. The fewest number of spill instructions is written to meet these rules.
    /// 5. Spill instructions are placed as early as possible.
    ///
    /// These rules are an attempt to make code paths that don't need to spill faster
    /// while not increasing code size too much.
    ///
    /// Considering just one value at a time for now, the steps are:
    ///
    /// 1. If the value is defined in a deferred block, or needs its value to be on
    ///    the stack during the definition block, emit a move right after the
    ///    definition and exit.
    /// 2. Build an array representing the state at each block, where the state can
    ///    be any of the following:
    ///    - unmarked (default/initial state)
    ///    - definition
    ///    - spill required
    ///    - spill required in non-deferred successor
    ///    - spill required in deferred successor
    /// 3. Mark the block containing the definition.
    /// 4. Mark as "spill required" all blocks that contain any part of a spilled
    ///    LiveRange, or any use that requires the value to be on the stack.
    /// 5. Walk the block list backward, setting the "spill required in successor"
    ///    values where appropriate. If both deferred and non-deferred successors
    ///    require a spill, then the result should be "spill required in non-deferred
    ///    successor".
    /// 6. Walk the block list forward, updating marked blocks to "spill required" if
    ///    all of their predecessors agree that a spill is required. Furthermore, if
    ///    a block is marked as "spill required in non-deferred successor" and any
    ///    non-deferred predecessor is marked as "spill required", then the current
    ///    block is updated to "spill required". We must mark these merge points as
    ///    "spill required" to obey rule #2 above: if we didn't, then there would
    ///    exist a control-flow path through two different spilled regions.
    /// 7. Walk the block list backward again, updating blocks to "spill required" if
    ///    all of their successors agree that a spill is required, or if the current
    ///    block is deferred and any of its successors require spills. If only some
    ///    successors of a non-deferred block require spills, then insert spill moves
    ///    at the beginning of those successors. If we manage to smear the "spill
    ///    required" value all the way to the definition block, then insert a spill
    ///    move at the definition instead. (Spilling at the definition implies that
    ///    we didn't emit any other spill moves, and there is a DCHECK mechanism to
    ///    ensure that invariant.)
    ///
    /// Loop back-edges can be safely ignored in every step. Anything that the loop
    /// header needs on-stack will be spilled either in the loop header itself or
    /// sometime before entering the loop, so its back-edge predecessors don't need
    /// to contain any data about the loop header.
    ///
    /// The operations described in those steps are simple Boolean logic, so we can
    /// easily process a batch of values at the same time as an optimization.
