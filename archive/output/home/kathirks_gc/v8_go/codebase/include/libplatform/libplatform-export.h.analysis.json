  "logic": "This header file defines the `V8_PLATFORM_EXPORT` macro, which is used to control the visibility of symbols (classes, functions, etc.) when building and using the V8 platform library as a shared library. The macro is defined differently depending on the operating system (Windows or other) and whether the library is being built (BUILDING_V8_PLATFORM_SHARED is defined) or used (USING_V8_PLATFORM_SHARED is defined). On Windows, `__declspec(dllexport)` is used to export symbols when building the library, and `__declspec(dllimport)` is used to import symbols when using the library. On other platforms (like Linux), `__attribute__((visibility(\"default\")))` is used to export symbols when building the library. If neither BUILDING_V8_PLATFORM_SHARED nor USING_V8_PLATFORM_SHARED is defined, the macro is defined as empty, meaning the symbols are not explicitly exported or imported. This likely implies they will have default visibility (potentially internal to the compilation unit)."
