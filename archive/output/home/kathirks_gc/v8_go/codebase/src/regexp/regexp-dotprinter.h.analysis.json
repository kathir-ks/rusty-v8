'label' likely provides a name or identifier for the graph being printed, and 'node' is the root node of the regular expression's abstract syntax tree or internal representation.  The DOT format is a graph description language, often used to visualize graphs. The method likely traverses the RegExpNode tree and outputs the corresponding DOT code to a file or stream."
