      "logic": "This function likely clobbers (overwrites) double-precision floating-point registers. It takes four double values as input. The purpose is likely to invalidate any existing values in floating-point registers, potentially to avoid incorrect optimizations or ensure memory consistency in specific scenarios, possibly related to garbage collection or context switching. The details of *how* it clobbers the registers is not specified in the header, and resides in the implementation (.cc) file. It might involve assigning specific values or performing some operations that force the compiler to reload registers from memory."
