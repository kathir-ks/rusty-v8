      "logic": "This function adds type assertions to the graph based on the schedule and a phase-specific zone.  It likely iterates through the nodes in the schedule and inserts nodes that check the types of values flowing through the graph. The JSGraph provides access to the current graph and its associated JavaScript-specific features. The schedule determines the execution order of the nodes. The zone is used for memory allocation of newly created nodes and data structures during this phase."
