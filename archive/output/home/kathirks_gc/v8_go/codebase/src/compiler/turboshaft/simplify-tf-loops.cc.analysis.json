It moves the loop node to be dominated by the dominating input of phis inside the loop, creating a new loop and related phi nodes to maintain correct value flow. It iterates through the uses of the loop node, handling Phi and EffectPhi nodes connected to the loop by splitting them and re-routing connections through a new loop. Nodes which are not Phis are added to a list of control uses, which are then updated to target the new loop."
