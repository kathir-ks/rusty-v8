Then, it copies the nodes within the loop body multiple times (determined by the unrolling count). After copying, it rewires the control flow, stack checks, loop exits, and phis to connect the unrolled iterations.  Terminate nodes are removed from all but the first iteration.  Loop exits are merged.  The inputs to the loop header and phis inside the loop are rewired to connect consecutive iterations."
