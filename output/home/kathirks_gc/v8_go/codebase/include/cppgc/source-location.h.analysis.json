This allows cppgc to use the v8's SourceLocation type directly without needing to specify the v8 namespace every time. It essentially re-exports the v8::SourceLocation type for convenience and clarity within the cppgc namespace."

  "logic": "This header file provides a convenient type alias within the `cppgc` namespace for `v8::SourceLocation`. This promotes code readability and simplifies the usage of V8's source location information within the C++ garbage collection (cppgc) context."
