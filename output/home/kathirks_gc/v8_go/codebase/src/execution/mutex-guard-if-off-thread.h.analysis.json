    "overall": "This header file defines a template class `MutexGuardIfOffThread`. The intended use case, based on the file name, is to provide a mutex guard that operates only when the current code is running off the main thread. This allows for optimization in cases where locking is unnecessary on the main thread. The class is likely to implement RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) for managing mutex locks. The actual implementation details would be in the corresponding `.cc` file."
