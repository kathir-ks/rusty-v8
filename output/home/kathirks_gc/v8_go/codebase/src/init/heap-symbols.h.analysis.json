  "comment": "This header file defines a set of macros that generate lists of internalized strings and private symbols used by the V8 JavaScript engine. Internalized strings are strings that are stored once in memory and reused, improving performance by reducing memory usage and string comparison time. Private symbols are used for internal properties that should not be accessed directly from JavaScript. The macros use a 'V' parameter, which is expected to be a macro that takes a name and a string literal, and defines a corresponding constant or variable for each string in the list."
