It takes pipeline data and a temporary zone as input and performs the loop unrolling optimization on the Turboshaft graph. The implementation details are not available in the header file but it presumably iterates over loops in the graph, determines which loops are profitable to unroll, and then duplicates the loop body multiple times to reduce loop overhead."
