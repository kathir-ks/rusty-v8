It currently uses CopyingPhase with several reducers (StringEscapeAnalysisReducer, JSGenericLoweringReducer, DataViewLoweringReducer, MachineLoweringReducer, FastApiCallLoweringReducer, VariableReducer, SelectLoweringReducer, MachineOptimizationReducer) to perform the lowering transformations. It also contains a TODO comment about potentially moving JSGenericLoweringReducer to the SimplifiedLowering phase in the future."
