    /// Multiple threads in V8 are allowed, but only one thread at a time is allowed
    /// to use any given V8 isolate, see the comments in the Isolate class. The
    /// definition of 'using a V8 isolate' includes accessing handles or holding onto
    /// object pointers obtained from V8 handles while in the particular V8 isolate.
    /// It is up to the user of V8 to ensure, perhaps with locking, that this
    /// constraint is not violated. In addition to any other synchronization
    /// mechanism that may be used, the v8::Locker and v8::Unlocker classes must be
    /// used to signal thread switches to V8.
    ///
    /// v8::Locker is a scoped lock object. While it's active, i.e. between its
    /// construction and destruction, the current thread is allowed to use the locked
    /// isolate. V8 guarantees that an isolate can be locked by at most one thread at
    /// any time. In other words, the scope of a v8::Locker is a critical section.
    ///
    /// Sample usage:
    /// \code
    /// ...
    /// {
    ///   v8::Locker locker(isolate);
    ///   v8::Isolate::Scope isolate_scope(isolate);
    ///   ...
    ///   // Code using V8 and isolate goes here.
    ///   ...
    /// } // Destructor called here
    /// \endcode
    ///
    /// If you wish to stop using V8 in a thread A you can do this either by
    /// destroying the v8::Locker object as above or by constructing a v8::Unlocker
    /// object:
    ///
    /// \code
    /// {
    ///   isolate->Exit();
    ///   v8::Unlocker unlocker(isolate);
    ///   ...
    ///   // Code not using V8 goes here while V8 can run in another thread.
    ///   ...
    /// } // Destructor called here.
    /// isolate->Enter();
    /// \endcode
    ///
    /// The Unlocker object is intended for use in a long-running callback from V8,
    /// where you want to release the V8 lock for other threads to use.
    ///
    /// The v8::Locker is a recursive lock, i.e. you can lock more than once in a
    /// given thread. This can be useful if you have code that can be called either
    /// from code that holds the lock or from code that does not. The Unlocker is
    /// not recursive so you can not have several Unlockers on the stack at once, and
    /// you cannot use an Unlocker in a thread that is not inside a Locker's scope.
    ///
    /// An unlocker will unlock several lockers if it has to and reinstate the
    /// correct depth of locking on its destruction, e.g.:
    ///
    /// \code
    /// // V8 not locked.
    /// {
    ///   v8::Locker locker(isolate);
    ///   Isolate::Scope isolate_scope(isolate);
    ///   // V8 locked.
    ///   {
    ///     v8::Locker another_locker(isolate);
    ///     // V8 still locked (2 levels).
    ///     {
    ///       isolate->Exit();
    ///       v8::Unlocker unlocker(isolate);
    ///       // V8 not locked.
    ///     }
    ///     isolate->Enter();
    ///     // V8 locked again (2 levels).
    ///   }
    ///   // V8 still locked (1 level).
