// This file undefines macros defined in api-macros.h.
// It doesn't have a direct Rust equivalent since Rust doesn't use macros in the same way as C++.
// The purpose of this file is to ensure that the macros are only defined within the scope they are intended for.
// In Rust, this can be achieved through proper module structure and scoping of functions and types.
// Therefore, no direct translation is necessary.

// The following is a placeholder to represent the module where these macros *were* defined
// and thus undefining them is no longer needed in the Rust version.

mod api_macros {
    // In C++, the macros defined in api-macros.h would have been "undef" here.
    // Rust handles this implicitly through module scoping.
