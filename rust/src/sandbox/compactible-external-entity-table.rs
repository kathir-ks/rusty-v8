    /// Table compaction:
    /// -----------------
    /// The table's spaces are to some degree self-compacting: since the freelists
    /// are sorted in ascending order, segments at the start of the table will
    /// usually be fairly well utilized, while later segments might become
    /// completely free, in which case they will be deallocated.
    /// However, as a single live entry may keep an entire segment alive, the
    /// following simple algorithm is used to compact a space if that is deemed
    /// necessary:
    ///  - At the start of the GC marking phase, determine if a space needs to be
    ///    compacted. This decision is mostly based on the absolute and relative
    ///    size of the freelist.
    ///  - If compaction is needed, this algorithm determines by how many segments
    ///    it would like to shrink the space (N). It will then attempt to move all
    ///    live entries out of these segments so that they can be deallocated
    ///    afterwards during sweeping.
    ///  - The algorithm then simply selects the last N segments for evacuation, and
    ///    it "marks" them for evacuation simply by remembering the start of the
    ///    first selected segment. Everything after this threshold value then
    ///    becomes the evacuation area. In this way, it becomes very cheap to test
    ///    if an entry or segment should be evacuated: only a single integer
    ///    comparison against the threshold is required. It also establishes a
    ///    simple compaction invariant: compaction always moves an entry at or above
    ///    the threshold to a new position before the threshold.
    ///  - During marking, whenever a live entry inside the evacuation area is
    ///    found, a new "evacuation entry" is allocated from the freelist (which is
    ///    assumed to have enough free slots) and the address of the handle in the
    ///    object owning the table entry is written into it.
    ///  - During sweeping, these evacuation entries are resolved: the content of
    ///    the old entry is copied into the new entry and the handle in the object
    ///    is updated to point to the new entry.
    ///
    /// When compacting, it is expected that the evacuation area contains few live
    /// entries and that the freelist will be able to serve all evacuation entry
    /// allocations. In that case, compaction is essentially free (very little
    /// marking overhead, no memory overhead). However, it can happen that the
    /// application allocates a large number of table entries during marking, in
    /// which case we might end up allocating new entries inside the evacuation area
    /// or even allocate entire new segments for the space that's being compacted.
    /// If that situation is detected, compaction is aborted during marking.
    ///
    /// This algorithm assumes that table entries (except for the null entry) are
    /// never shared between multiple objects. Otherwise, the following could
    /// happen: object A initially has handle H1 and is scanned during incremental
    /// marking. Next, object B with handle H2 is scanned and marked for
    /// evacuation. Afterwards, object A copies the handle H2 from object B.
    /// During sweeping, only object B's handle will be updated to point to the
    /// new entry while object A's handle is now dangling. If shared entries ever
    /// become necessary, setting pointer handles would have to be guarded by
    /// write barriers to avoid this scenario.
