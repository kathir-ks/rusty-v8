// This C++ file only includes a header file, which suggests
// that the main functionality resides in the header file itself or
// in other linked libraries.  Therefore, we would typically translate
// the header file's contents into Rust here, creating corresponding
// structs, enums, and function signatures.  However, since we only
// have the .cc file and it is empty, we can only create an empty module.
// If there was actual code in the .cc file beyond including the .h,
// it would be translated here.

mod arguments {
    // Placeholder for the arguments module.  If the arguments.h header
    // file contained declarations, we would define corresponding Rust
    // structs, enums, and functions here.
