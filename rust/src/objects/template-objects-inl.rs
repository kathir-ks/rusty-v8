// This Rust code provides a basic structure mirroring the C++ header file.
// Due to the heavy reliance on V8 internals and Torque-generated code,
// a complete translation isn't feasible without access to the full codebase
// and its build system. This example demonstrates the general approach.

pub mod template_objects {
    // Re-export necessary types or define placeholders
    // Based on src/objects/template-objects.h
    pub struct TemplateObjectDescription {

    }

    impl TemplateObjectDescription {

//  - This file is auto-generated by Torque and cannot be directly translated
//    without the Torque toolchain. It typically contains implementations
//    of methods and constructors. A placeholder is provided to represent it.
//    In a full port, Torque would need to be used to generate equivalent Rust code.

// object-macros.h and object-macros-undef.h
// - These files heavily rely on C++ macros for defining object layouts,
//   accessors, and constructors. A complete translation would require
//   re-implementing these macros in Rust, potentially using procedural macros.
//   For this example, they are omitted and would need to be addressed
//   as part of a comprehensive port.

// Example usage of the structures and modules.  This mirrors the
// TQ_OBJECT_CONSTRUCTORS_IMPL macro.

// This would typically be auto-generated by Torque
