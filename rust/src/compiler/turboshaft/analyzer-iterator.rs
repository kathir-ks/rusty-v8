    /// Instead, the visitation order offered by AnalyzerIterator is a BFS in the

    /// it dominates), with an subtlety for loops: when a node dominates multiple
    /// nodes, successors that are in the same loop as the current node are visited
    /// before nodes that are in outer loops.

    /// In order to avoid visiting loop exits (= blocks whose dominator is in a loop
    /// but which aren't themselves in the loop) multiple times, the stack of Blocks
    /// to visit contains pairs of "block, generation". Additionally, we have a
    /// global {current_generation_} counter, which is incremented when we revisit a
    /// loop. When visiting a block, we record in {visited_} that it has been visited
    /// at {current_generation_}. When we pop a block from the stack and its
    /// "generation" field is less than what is recorded in {visited_}, then we skip
    /// it. On the other hand, if its "generation" field is greater than the one
    /// recorded in {visited_}, it means that we've revisited a loop since the last
    /// time we visited this block, so we should revisit it as well.
