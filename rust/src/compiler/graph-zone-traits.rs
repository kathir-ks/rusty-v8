// src/compiler/graph-zone-traits.h

// This file defines traits and types related to memory management within the
// graph compilation zone.  It uses conditional compilation based on the
// `kCompressGraphZone` flag to determine whether to use compressed pointers.

/// A placeholder for the Node type.
/// In the original C++ code, this would be a forward declaration
/// to allow the definition of `ZoneNodePtr` before the `Node` class
/// definition.
///
/// Replace with the actual Node struct when available.
#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct Node {}

/// A type alias for a pointer to a `Node` allocated in a zone.
/// It might be a compressed pointer depending on the `kCompressGraphZone` flag.
pub type ZoneNodePtr = *mut Node;

// In C++, this functionality leverages templates and a compile-time constant
// `kCompressGraphZone`.  Rust doesn't directly support compile-time constants
// affecting type definitions in the same way. We can use conditional compilation
// based on features.

// This is a simplified representation.  For a full implementation, you'd
// need to consider how to represent the `ZoneTypeTraits` template and the
// compressed pointer mechanism in Rust.  Likely this would involve a custom
// implementation using `unsafe` code and careful memory management.

// Assuming kCompressGraphZone is a feature flag to choose between implementations.
